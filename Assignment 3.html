<h1>Traveling in Depression</h1>
<p>
  When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine 
  different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.
</p>
<p>
  At five, I <a href=" https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Empire_State_Building ">marveled</a> at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, 
  I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient,
   megalithic structure of Stonehenge and <a href="/day 3.html "><img src="girl.png" width="150px"></a> walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in place just as it is in 
<a href="https://starzit.com/category/latest/">Starz University.</a>
</p>
<p>
  It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first
language became interested in language.
</p>
<p>
  It began with French, which taught me the importance of

pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris

where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it
PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on
the A, she looked at me bewildered.

<p>In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and
aware of its similarities with English through cognates.
Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks
different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to
me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates
come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish. <a href = "https:// koikoijohnson@gmail.com ">Send Us Email</a>
